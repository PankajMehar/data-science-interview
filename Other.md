* What is Regularization? What is the difference in the outcome (coefficients) between the L1 and L2 norms? (usually I ask them to draw the geometric shape of the functions, just to make sure)
* Which libraries for Analytics/DS you are familiar in Python? (0ne or two questions)
* Describe a Data Science project that you led/participated.

* How do you fit a non-linear relation between X (age) and Y (income) in a Linear Model? Other methods?
* train/test/validate sets, cross-validation, parameter selection, predictor selection, etc.

## Data exploration
* How do you summarize the distribution of your data?
* How do you handle outliers or data points that skew data?
* What assumptions can you make? Why and when? (i.e When is it safe to assume "normal")
