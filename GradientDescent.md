* What is the Gradient Descent Method (the intuition is mostly enough)?
* Is it necessary that the Gradient Descent Method will always find the global minima? (I also expect candidates in this level to guide me through the intuition and some math behind the method)
* Does the Gradient Descent method always converge to the same point?
