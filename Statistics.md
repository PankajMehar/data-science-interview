* How you can fit non-linear relations between X (say, Age) and Y (say, Income) into a Linear Model? - I also expect candidates to show me mathematically the marginal effect of X on Y based on their proposed solution.
* What is the probability to get the sum 2 if I have 2 equally weighted dice? Now with 4? 7?
* What is an eigenvalue? (linear algebra)
* I usually ask a question for evaluation familiarity with Bayes Law ("I have two Coins..")
* What is Box-Cox transformation?
* What is Multicollinearity ? How can we solve it?
